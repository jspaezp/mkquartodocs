# This is a simple example that uses python

You can take a look at the .qmd that generated this docs
from:

[https://github.com/jspaezp/mkquartodocs/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/jspaezp/mkquartodocs/tree/main/docs)


But we can use python to check the contents of this file!

```{python}
with open("example.qmd", "r") as f:
    for l in f:
        print("> ", str(l))

```


# Hello

Here is some text


```{python}
print("Hello World")
```

Here is how warnings look


```{python}
import warnings
warnings.warn("This is a warning")
```

Some python logic


```{python}
# Fizz buzz as a simple list comprehension
out = ["Fizz"*(i%3==0)+"Buzz"*(i%5==0) or str(i) for i in range(1, 101)]
print(out)
```

And finally an error just to see how it looks


```{python}
#| error: true
raise NotImplementedError
```
